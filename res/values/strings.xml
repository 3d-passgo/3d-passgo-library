    <string name="faq_question_10">What is PassGo?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_10">  PassGo is a graphical password scheme derived from the \"Go Game\", an accent Chinese game, and that is where the name comes from.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_15">What is 3D PassGo?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_15">  3D PassGo extends PassGo to a 3D space: a user draws dots and/or lines on a 3D grid. The 3D grid can be optionally rotated and zoomed in or out to further improve the security. </string>

    <string name="faq_question_30">Is PassGo secure?</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_30">  In PassGo, the security can be fine-tuned by adjusting the grid size which is available from 1x1x1 to 19x19x19.
	    In addition, PassGo allows multiple strokes, namely you can draw multiple dots and lines. The larger the grid size is and the larger the stroke
	    number is, the more secure your passwrod will be. Such, a user can choose a password at any desired security level with appropriate usability.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_40">How do I enter a PassGo?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_40">  In PassGo, a user clicks or draws through the intersections of a grid, as a way to input a password.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_50">How do I draw a dot?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_50">  To draw a dot, touch an intersection on the grid and then lift your finger.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_60">How do I draw a line?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_60">  To draw a line, touch multiple intersections continuously and then lift your finger.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_65">How do I rotate the grid?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_65">  Touch the screen just around(not too far) or inside the grid without touching any intersections, and then keep moving on the screen, the grid will rotate.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_66">How do I zoom in or out the grid?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_66">  Place two fingers on the grid and then adjust the distance between the two fingers, the grid will zoom in or out.</string>

    <string name="faq_question_67">How do I move the grid?</string>
    <string name="faq_answer_67">  Touch the screen without touching any intersections, hold for one second, and then the grid will start to move with the finger;
        in addition when finish zooming, you can also hold one finger for one second after lifting the other finger, and the grid will also move along the finger.
    (Note, moving grid only works on grid size smaller than 9x9x9)</string>

    <string name="faq_question_70">Do I have to draw PassGo in exactly the same way as how I set up?</string>
	<string name="faq_answer_70">  Yes. PassGo requires to be drawn in EXACTLY the same way as how it was set up. For example, if you click the an
	    intersection twice when you set up PassGo, then you must click the same intersection twice when you login, even though you only see one dot on the grid
	    (the other dot is overlapped in this case).</string>
